**Discipline to which the Lab belongs : Electronics Engineering Lab**

**Name of experiment: To explain the functioning of logic gates and draw
their truth table, and to minimize the no of logic gates in the circuit
with the help of universal gates.**

**Round 2** **2.1 Story Outline: Identification of Different logic
circuit label with corresponding symbol, selecting correct output
expression and predicting output of logic gate for given input.
Completion of truth tables of logic gates correctly. Prediction of the
step by step output of complex circuit until final output is predicted
correctly, to find final expression in term of input, to find simplified
expression of complex circuit in term of input. Simplify the complex
logic circuit with the help of universal logic gates, and compare the
truth table of complex circuit and simplified circuit.** **2. Story:**
**2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:**

The simulator will consist of three stages in first stage student will
identify the symbols and expression with the corresponding label of
logic gate, predict the output of selected logic gate with given input
and complete the truth table of selected logic gate. The simulator will
include text box, drag and drop option, symbols of basic logic gates,
expression of logic gates, input box, table (truth table) with drop down
option.

The left section will display the labels of different logic gates and a
text box will be on right side, which will ask the students to select
the logic gate label, after selection of label the color of label box
will changed to green and two question box will appear on the right side
which will asked the student to drag and drop the symbol and output
expression on the designated box. After correct selection of symbol and
output expression a simple question based on selected logic gate will
appear and students will be asked to fill the correct output in the
input box. After correct selection the students will be asked to
complete the truth table. The truth table will have all the combination
of possible input and students have to use the drop down menu to
complete the output section of truth table. After correctly completing
the truth table the selected label on the left side will turn grey and
it cannot be selected, now a text box will appear be on right side,
which will ask the students to select the logic gate label and proceed
as above until all levels are turned grey. The pictorial view is
presented below for the same.Then next button will appear after all the
levels are turned grey, on clicking the next button students will reach
to stage 2.

In stage 2 students will be given a logic circuit, a circuit diagram
will appear on the simulator screen which will consist of combination of
different logic gates and students need to predict the step by step
output of the given circuit until final output is correctly predicted.
Every output section will consist of drop down menu which will have
option 0 and 1. After successfully filling the final output correctly, a
question will appear below the logic circuit which will asked the
students to fill the output expression in terms of input in the provided
input box. After successfully filling the output another question will
appear below the previous question section. This question will be asked
to fill the simplified expression after applying Boolean operation
and/or Demorgan law in the box provided.

In stage 3 students will be given a logic circuit, a circuit diagram
will appear on the simulator screen which will consist of combination of
different logic gates and students need to Simplify the circuit using
universal logic gates using drag and drop option. After completing the
circuit and pushing the simulate button simulator will compare the truth
table of both circuit if both truth table is matched different
difficulty mode will unlock.
