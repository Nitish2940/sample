## 1.2 About the Experiment:

<p>The experiment is designed to explain the functioning of logic gates and draw their truth table.</p>


## 1.3 Learning Objectives:

<p>Write Learning Objectives that can be achieved using virtual labs and the respective cognitive level,  action verbs.</p>
<table>

<td>1</td><td>Students will be able to <strong>identify</strong> different logic gates </td><td> Remember</td> <td> Identify </td></tr>

<tr><td> 2.</td><td>  Students will be able to <strong>explain</strong> functioning of different logic gates </td><td> Understand </td><td> Explain </td></tr>
<tr><td>3.</td><td>  Students will be able to <strong>predict</strong> the output of different logic gates and complete the truth table </td><td> Apply</td><td>  Predict </td></tr>
<tr><td> 4.</td><td>   Students will be able to <strong>solve</strong> the given logic circuit </td><td> Apply </td><td> Solve </td></tr>

## 2. Instructional Strategy:

<p>Expository Instructional Strategy will be used for this virtual lab truth table of different logic gates</p><br>

## 2.1 Instructional Strategy:

Expository

## 2.2 Assessment Method:

<p>Formative assessment</p>

## 2.3 Description of sections:

<p>Students will first able to identify the symbols of different logic gates and then they will be made aware of their functioning and expression of their output for given inputs. Students then will calculate the output for given inputs and complete the truth table for a single logic gate. After students learned the functioning of simple logic gates they will analyze the circuit consist of a combination of logic gates. Students will then compare the logic gate circuit for the combination of the logic gate and will replace the gates with a universal gate.</p>
